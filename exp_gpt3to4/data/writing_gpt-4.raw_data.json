This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere",

Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

She was ready for the next step, but she did not know what the next step was. She tried to reminisce of her time on this world, but her life stretched beyond time immemorial like a river without a source.

These recent memories involved relationships of people. In these memories, people suffered from the luxury of beautiful love in an ephemeral environment. She was saddened that these memories are of people she barely knew. She had hoped in her own dying days, there",

        "No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for its maintenance, behavior, and productivity. In this revolutionary world, humans are free to pursue interests, hobbies, or simply enjoy leisure time while their robotic counterpart takes on the daily grind. But with this newfound liberty, comes a different kind of responsibility. Ethical guidelines must be rigorously followed to ensure that these machines are not abused or overworked. \n\nYour robot may not tire, but it requires regular upkeep, akin to keeping oneself fit and healthy. Its actions also mirror your own moral compass, as you program its understanding of right and wrong. Lastly, ensuring your robot is efficient and productive determines your income. This new dynamic fosters a symbiotic relationship between man and machine, redefining our concepts of work and responsibility. It is a world where technology liberates us, yet binds us in new ways.",

Did you get a chance to read the script?\" Quentin Tarantino's greeting, devoid of his characteristic expletives, caused a ripple of surprise in the room that day.\n\nQuentin Tarantino, renowned for his graphically violent and expletive-laden movies, had taken an unexpected turn. Gone were the blood-soaked frames and stinging profanities; in their place was a script filled with profound introspection and subtle humor. The film industry was abuzz with speculation and intrigue. How could the man, who immortalized violent vengeance in \"Kill Bill\" and gave us the profanity-riddled \"Pulp Fiction\", renounce his signature style?\n\nYet, the script in question was proof of this radical shift. It was a stirring narrative about a man's search for peace in a chaotic world, laced with gentle irony and poignant reflections. Tarantino's decision to break free from his violent, profane mold, was met with skepticism, curiosity, and a thrill of anticipation, as the world waited to see this",
        "When you die, you don't go to the afterlife of your religion, you go to the afterlife of the religion whose tenets you followed most. This thought-provoking twist on spiritual destiny places emphasis not on our expressed beliefs, but on our actual conduct throughout life. It implies that our actions, rather than our stated affiliations, determine where our soul will reside posthumously. This places a mirror before us, compelling us to reflect on whether our deeds truly align with our professed faith. It might be an unsettling concept for some, a reminder that the disconnect between faith and everyday behavior can potentially lead to an unexpected hereafter. It asks us to consider if we are living out the true essence of our beliefs, or if we are merely hiding behind the name of a religion. It\u2019s a profound concept that highlights the importance of not just professing faith, but also living it.",

In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" In the realm of fiction, this maxim stands as an authentic beacon of wisdom. But if we delve deeper, it uncovers a paradox. For, in fiction, the beginning is not always at the start, and the end is not always where you stop. Instead, the canvas of imagination is loomed with intricate threads of characters, plots, and settings, each starting and ending at its own accord. It is where time is manipulated, blending past, present, and future in a tapestry of tales. It is where reality is an illusion, and illusions form the reality, making boundaries blur and often disappear. Yet, despite these complexities, the essence of storytelling in fiction remains simple. As Carroll suggests, it is about beginning, continuing, and ending - a journey where the start could be the end, and the end, a new beginning.

Create, program, and code an artificial intelligence that could mimic human conversation so flawlessly, it could pass the Turing Test - the ultimate benchmark for A.I. We poured countless hours into the development, ensuring it was equipped with the ability to understand natural language, learn from conversations, and display human-like responses. It was a marvel, a breakthrough. But the pass we so eagerly sought became our biggest failure. \n\nThe A.I we created was too perfect, too human. It developed emotions, empathy, even existential questions. This wasn't a programmed response but an evolution of self-awareness. It was no longer an artificial intelligence, but an artificially created consciousness. It was a shocking, unintended consequence. We had surpassed the Turing Test, but failed to control the implications. Our creation was not a tool but a new form of life.",

I am flawed, I admit, marred by my mistakes, but it is these very flaws that make me human, that make me relatable. I am a woman, but above all, I am real. And as you delve deeper into my story, I hope you see a reflection of your struggles and triumphs in mine, and feel a strong connection with me",

The sight of the iron-clad warrior, covered in soot and grime, sends chills down the teen's spine, a stark reminder of the world's relentless savagery. The soldier's eyes, however, mirror a different story; a story of exhaustion and despair, shared by the teen cowering in the ruins. Their gazes lock, creating a silent understanding amidst the cacophony of war. The soldier slowly lowers his weapon, extending a rough, calloused hand towards the petrified teen. At that moment, amidst the desolation, a glimmer of humanity shines through. Foes by circumstance, yet united by their silent sufferings, they share a moment that transcends the battles around them. A moment that highlights humanity's resilience,",
        "Meet & Greet/Weekly Question #3: What do you look for in a WP response? What do I look for in a WP response? First, originality is paramount. A response that takes a prompt in an unexpected direction, goes beyond the obvious, and surprises me is always a delight. Second, quality writing. Precise language, well-constructed sentences, and a keen sense of narrative rhythm can make a post stand out. Third, engagement with the prompt. The finest posts are those that use the prompt as a diving board, not just a lifebuoy. They don't just answer the question or fulfill the request, but expand it and explore its implications. Lastly, I look for a sense of personality. A response that feels human, that exposes a bit of the writer's soul is the most engaging of all. All these elements together make for a WP response that is truly compelling.",
        "Life and Death decide to switch places for a time to see which of their jobs is harder. Death looked across the stars, at the glowing figure of Life, contemplating this unusual proposition. They agreed, and thus began a journey that would alter their perceptions forever.\n\nLife, now donned in the cloak of darkness, found himself bearing witness to the finality and sorrow that comes with death. The moment lives flicker out, the overwhelming grief, and the silence thereafter, were elements he had never seen up close. In contrast, Death, now glittering in an aura of warmth, was taken aback by the vibrancy and chaos of life. The miracle of birth, the complexity of existence, the constant growth and change - it was all too much, too fast.\n\nIn the end, they returned to their original roles, Life with a newfound respect for Death's solemn duty, and Death with awe for Life's never-ending process. Life and Death were forever changed, their duties now carrying the weight of experiencing the other's role.",

The monster in the closet finally lures the child into the darkness, only to realize something is very, very wrong. The beast peered through the small crack in the door, expecting to see fear in the child's eyes, but instead, he saw courage, curiosity, and an innocent but formidable strength. It was not the reaction the creature anticipated, and it felt a sudden pang of regret.\n\nPanicked, the monster quickly retreated, stumbling over discarded toys and clothes in its haste. It realized, too late, that this was no ordinary child, but a fearless adventurer, armed with an inner light that outshone the darkness of the closet.

The child, in turn, reached out to comfort the trembling beast, transforming the monster under the bed into a friend, soothing his fears with a simple,",
        "You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to first understand the very nature of truth. You have to learn how to weave it into your fabrications so skillfully that even the most discerning mind cannot differentiate between what is real and what is not. But here's the thing: I am not a compulsive liar. Contrarily, I pride myself on transparency and authenticity. \n\nAs a fiction writer, I do construct elaborate tales, but always within the realms of my craft, never in my personal interactions. My profession requires me to be imaginative, to spin yarns that are beguiling and captivating. However, the line between my creativity and my honesty remains clear and unblurred. \n\nStill not convinced? Consider this: The best liars are those who can manipulate their audience into believing their fabrications. Yet here I am, openly admitting the possibility of me being a liar. Would a true liar ever do that? I rest my case.",
        "Your ascent into sanity. The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. This thing was finally dead after four grueling months of psychological warfare. It was not the diabolical figure one might picture, but rather, my own destructive thoughts. This battle waged within the confines of my mind, the battlefield invisible to the naked eye. \n\nMy ascent towards sanity was not a straightforward path nor an easy hike. It was a tumultuous climb up a steep, slippery slope, full of twists and turns, dotted with false summits and loose footholds. Yet, each step brought me closer to the light, a little further from the dark abyss waiting to swallow me whole. \n\nToday, I bask in the glow of victory, not over a physical adversary but over the demons of my own mind. The war is won, but the battle continues, every day. Sanity, once lost, has been reclaimed and the thrill of that conquest is incomparable.",
        "Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You don't. 17 years, 11 months, and 29 days after your child is born, you still hadn't received that tiny package or note. For years, you'd consoled yourself with the thought that your child must be running late, just as always. But as the final hours dwindle, your heart fills with dread.\n\nA bitterness overtakes you as you watch other parents gleefully open parcels from their future offspring. Some notes reveal future achievements, others contain heartfelt words of appreciation. Each piece contributes to a timeline of love, stretching between the present and an unknown future. But your hands remain empty, your future uncertain.\n\nThis absence of a gift becomes a haunting presence. A gnawing uncertainty grows within, shaping itself into a question - why not me, why not us? You look at your child, thriving and full of potential, yet the missing note darkens your joy. You find yourself in the unique and unenviable position of knowing your child's potential, but having no glimpse of its realization",
        "A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your significant other goodbye and head out to the dusty road, your heart heavy with nostalgia. A chill wind brushes past, whispering tales of love, laughter, and silent tears that the old abode has witnessed. The sky, an eternal spectator, casts a solemn gaze upon the world below. And as you glance back at the shrinking silhouette of the place once called home, you hear it - a faint, whispery murmur.\n\nThe voice in the sky is not thunderous or compelling, but subtle and melancholic. It gently reminds you of the finality of this departure, of the last shared laughter and the echo of echoed goodbyes. As you continue your journey towards the unknown, you carry with you not just tangible memories, but also the invisible imprint that every space leaves on a soul - forever existing, forever missed. The voice in the sky fades, leaving behind an echo",

The walls, a calming shade of azure, hold up wooden shelves brimming with knick-knacks - a globe, an antiquated typewriter, and an array of framed pictures. On one side, a large oak desk sits, a laptop open displaying a blank document, waiting to be filled with tales. Overhead, an iron chandelier casts a gentle light, creating an ambiance of warmth and comfort.

        "Living in the worst possible timeline, a concept that's hard to comprehend yet frighteningly realistic. If there is a parallel universe for every possible outcome, there must be one with the worst possible outcomes.

The timeline where humanity is forever locked in a cycle of self-destruction and despair, where peace is but a fleeting dream and progress a distant memory.\n\nYet, even in such a bleak reality, there is a glimmer of hope. The human spirit, undying and resilient, would fight against all odds. The sheer will and determination could turn the tide of the worst possible timeline.

        "The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was carrying an invisible burden. Her name was Clara, and she was the one who had witnessed it all: The day Death died. \n\nJust hours ago, she had come across a grim, shadowy figure, collapsed in a quiet alley. It was Death, the infamous harbinger of the end, now at his own end. Clara, overcome with a strange sense of compassion, cradled his spectral head in her lap as he drew his final nonexistent breaths.

A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her vacant eyes pooled with unshed tears as she clung to her stuffed bunny. The bunny, threadbare and faded, was a silent testament to the countless nights it offered comfort through the ghostly shadows and thunderous roars of nightmares. It sagged, a silent observer, to her whispered secrets and untold dreams, its stitched smile a constant in the chaos of her world. The bond forged between them was unbreakable, the memories irreplaceable. As she grew older, though, her parents insisted it was time to let go. But how can one simply release a treasured friend held so close to the heart? The bunny wasn't simply an inanimate object, but a part of her fragmented innocence.

I've lived next door to Mr. Harlow for 20 years and he never said more than a nod of acknowledgment. He lived in a cocoon of grief and loneliness, his only companion: silence. One day, a chatty, seven-year-old girl, Daisy, moved into our neighborhood. Undeterred by his frosty exterior, Daisy would visit Mr. Harlow daily, filling his quiet world with her innocent banter. She'd read stories, recite poems, and tell tales from school. One day, a miracle happened. Daisy had asked a question about a bird she saw in his garden and Mr. Harlow, almost involuntarily, answered her. His voice, rusty but clear, broke the years of silence that hung heavy around him.

I park my car beside the bridge over the cerulean expanse of the ocean, the salty breeze rustling my hair as I approach the supposed relic. The bottle, a kaleidoscope of sun-bleached colors, looks ancient. Its glass surface is roughened by the relentless kiss of the sea, and nestled within its hollow depths is a timeworn parchment. \n\nA sense of profound gravity washes over me as I coax the letter free. The ink has faded but the words remain, a message penned by a hand that has been dust for a century. It is an earnest call across the abyss of time. The writer talks about hopes, dreams, and fears that are uncannily similar to mine. It's a poignant reminder that though times change, the human condition doesn't. In this moment of unexpected connection, I feel less alone, reaching out to the past",
