You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle! Ha!\" Death snorted. \"Yes, the circle. I've seen it I don't know how many times now.\" \"It's been about thirty.\" \"Okay, so I've seen it thirty times, and each time manages to be just as beautiful as the last.\" \"How? You've lost everyone you've ever loved, seen the world blown to pieces again and again. How can you still be in love with that damn circle? You know I told you that as a joke.\" \"It doesn't matter.

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer. They were crying for their mother,",

But of course, that's what bodyguards are for! \"The water park Giovanni?

She doesn't struggle. They always struggle. \"Stay quiet,\" I tell her. Although, I don't need to. She hasn't uttered a single word. No screams, no fighting, absolutely nothing. It's almost boring. I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second. I see the family dog lying on her bed. Or, rather, what's left of it. It's hard to make out this late, but all I can see is shredded blanket. The dog cowers in the back.

Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand.

They were long and meandering, more adventuresome than your simple afternoon stroll. We would walk, hand in hand, and observe things about our environment. It was what we loved to do. Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose. One of my own quirks. She drew me up. She loved the sunset, the kiss of the wind. She saw what I couldn't in them. She raised my gaze, changed my perspective.

        "Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",

It was complex and alluring with its fine details in a myriad of rich colors. The sources of the sand were unassuming in their natural state, taken alone.

Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).
