While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in.

More recently, Adeyemo (2005) demonstrated that adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to become chronic drug users than adolescents from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, while providing other family-based variables such as family composition, stability, and emotional support did not protect from drug use for lower socioeconomic groups of adolescents. These findings are consistent with the Adeyemo study (2005) where the researchers showed that poverty among youth is positively related to the severity of drug problems, as well as other forms of substance use.
