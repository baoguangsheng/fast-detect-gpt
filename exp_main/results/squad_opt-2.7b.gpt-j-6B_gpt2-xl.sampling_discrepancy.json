Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept, self-image, self-perception, or value. Self-esteem is associated with well-being. So, how can a parent help their child get good self-esteem? There are essentially three ways to encourage good self-esteem, both as a parent and later in life. The first of these ideas is to promote love and connection. We can learn this with our children as a family. For example, if we talk about our own strengths and recognize that our children may not share our same strengths, we as parents have a role in bringing out their unique qualities and supporting them to see the positive in their strengths. For example, during an Easter egg hunt, the parents might say to the child and tell them how good they look in their Easter dress. In turn, this teaches the child to notice these things.
